# Understanding deep learning
The aim of this repo is to list some of the deep learning resources to go through in order to better understand core concepts, architectures, and techniques of deep learning. A paper to read is to be decided by participants each week. 

## Thursday 19th November 2018
AlexNet is one of the first architectures that has deep layers (eight layers: 5 convolutional layers and 3 fully-connected layers), reducing the Top-5 error rate by ~9% on the 2010 ImageNet classification competition.
